# sqdigits
Calculates the square of each digit of a given number.

# How does this script work?
This script works by converting the passed number into a string, and then onto an array. I then iterate over the returned array and increment the result by the element at the current index of the iteration to the 2nd power. When there are no values remained, it finally parses the result into an integer and returns that value.
